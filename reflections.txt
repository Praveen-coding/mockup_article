*What new skills have you learned?

I learned how to edit and build a simple web page by using some HTML basic tags such as:-
 -making paragrapgh with <p>Text Content</p> tag 
 -making link with anchor tag <a href="link goes here">Link Name</a> 
 -inserting images directly through web and through local directories using <img src"Image source goes here" alt="Image description goes here"> tag 
 -striking text through <strike>Text Content</strike> 
 -emphasising text through <em>text content</em> 
 -subscripting text through <sub>text content</sub> 
 -supscripting text through <sup>text content</sup> 
 -breaking line with <br>(a standalone tag) 
 -horizontal line through <hr>(a standalone tag) 
 -making figure by <figure> tag 
 and many other tags.
